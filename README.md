## Description

This is a larger scale E-Commerce platform made with Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, jQuery and MySQL database with and security implementations. The customer can log in, browse, filter and search for products, make purchases and checkout with Paypal and credit cart and recieve an order confirmation. There is a separate login for administrators, shippers and salespersons to manage users, categories, brands, products, customers orders and sales report (manage the product system, shipping and sales.) The application uses Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for the data access layer, and Spring Security for authentication and role-based authorization. Thymeleaf template engine is used for creating dynamic view pages and Bootstrap and jQuery is used for creating responsive, mobile-friendly web pages. Spring RESTful Webservices is used in conjunction with jQuery on the client side. JUnit, Spring Test, AssertJ and Mockito are used for unit and integration tests.

This is probably the largest application I built so far and the most interesting in that I gained a great understading of larger scale application architecture.
