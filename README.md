The store has security implementations where the customer can log in, browse, filter and search for products, make purchases and checkout with Paypal or credit cart and recieve an order confirmation via E-mail. There is a separate login for administrators, shippers and salespersons to manage the product system, users, customer orders, sales report and shipping. 

The application uses Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for the data access layer, and Spring Security for authentication and role-based authorization. Thymeleaf template engine is used for creating dynamic view pages and Bootstrap and jQuery is used for creating responsive, mobile-friendly web pages. Spring RESTful Webservices is used with jQuery on the client side.
