## Description

This comprehensive full-stack E-Commerce platform was built using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, jQuery, and a MySQL database.

The platform features robust security measures, offering customers the ability to log in, browse, filter, search for products, make purchases, and checkout using either PayPal or credit cards, with order confirmations sent via email. Administrators, shippers, and salespersons have separate logins for managing the product system, users, customer orders, sales reports, and shipping.

The application leverages Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for efficient data access, while Spring Security ensures authentication and role-based authorization. Dynamic view pages are crafted using the Thymeleaf template engine, while responsive, mobile-friendly web pages are created with Bootstrap and jQuery. Spring RESTful Web Services, along with jQuery is used on the client side.

Unit and integration testing are ensured through JUnit, Spring Test, AssertJ, and Mockito.
